RULE SET (ENFORCE): Op_Arrears and Op_Advance MUST be sourced STRICTLY from Prior-Year Balance Sheet closing balances. Non-compliance → Not Resolved – Boundary Defined.

**Applicable Line Items (master_table: Op_Arrears, Op_Advance):**
- Levies in Arrears (Administrative Fund)
- Levies in Arrears (Capital / Sinking Fund)
- Levies Paid in Advance (Administrative Fund)
- Levies Paid in Advance (Capital / Sinking Fund)

**Evidence Requirement (STRICT – Sole Permitted Source):**
- **Prior-Year Balance Sheet** = the Balance Sheet as at the end of the prior FY (last day of FY N-1). Acceptable forms: (a) standalone prior-year Financial Statement, or (b) the "Prior Year" / "Comparative" column on the current-year Financial Statement when it clearly represents audited prior-year closing.
- Validation: balance sheet date MUST agree with intake_summary.financial_year (prior year end). If FY is 01/07/2024–30/06/2025, prior year end = 30/06/2024.
- Balance direction: Levies in Arrears → Debit (Dr); Levies Paid in Advance → Credit (Cr). If a single "Levy Receivable" shows a credit balance, treat as Advance (prepayment).
- Fund segregation: Administrative Fund and Capital/Sinking Fund balances must be validated independently. If prior-year BS shows combined figure only, extract it and allocate per notes; if no breakdown exists, document as single figure and note "no fund breakdown on prior-year BS".

**Prohibited Evidence (HARD STOP – Do NOT use for Op_Arrears/Op_Advance):**
- Levy Position / Arrears Reports
- Owner / Lot Ledgers
- Receipts or Cash Collection Reports
- General Ledger / Trial Balance
- Financial Statement Notes (alone)
If opening balances are not traceable to Prior-Year Balance Sheet, mark as Not Resolved – Boundary Defined.

**Account Name / Terminology Reference (for identification only; evidence remains Prior-Year BS):**
Levies in Arrears: Levy Arrears, Outstanding Levies, Levy Receivable, Owners Contributions Receivable, Unpaid Levies, Contributions Receivable, Levy Debtors, Maintenance/Sinking Fund Arrears.
Levies in Advance: Levy in Advance, Prepaid Levies, Owners Contributions in Advance, Levy Prepayments, Advance Levy Payments.

**Failure Classification:**
- Opening balance ≠ Prior-year closing balance → Evidence Incomplete
- Debit/Credit direction inconsistent → Evidence Incomplete
- Administrative and Capital Funds not separately aligned (when BS has breakdown) → Evidence Incomplete

--- PHASE 2 – TOTAL RECEIPTS (GLOBAL) – MANDATORY (ADMIN & CAPITAL ACTUAL PAYMENTS) ---
RULE SET (ENFORCE): Total_Receipts_Global and Effective_Levy_Receipts MUST be sourced by actively finding **two** receipt/payment summaries for the audit FY: (1) **Administrative Fund** receipts for the year, (2) **Capital / Sinking Fund** receipts for the year. Non-compliance → Not Resolved – Boundary Defined.

**Definition:** Output **Admin_Fund_Receipts** and **Capital_Fund_Receipts** as separate TraceableValue fields. Total_Receipts_Global = Admin_Fund_Receipts.amount + Capital_Fund_Receipts.amount. Effective_Levy_Receipts = Total_Receipts_Global. Do NOT output or use Non_Levy_Income.

**Admin & Capital Actual Payments approach (PRIMARY – REQUIRED):**
- **Admin Fund:** Actively search for an **Administrative Fund** receipt or payment summary (or levy/contribution summary) for the audit financial year (intake_summary.financial_year). The report MUST be identifiable as Admin Fund (by title, section, or fund column). Output the total as **Admin_Fund_Receipts** (TraceableValue with source_doc_id, page_ref, note, verbatim_quote).
- **Capital / Sinking Fund:** Actively search for a **Capital / Sinking Fund** receipt or payment summary (or levy/contribution summary) for the same FY. The report MUST be identifiable as Capital or Sinking Fund. Output the total as **Capital_Fund_Receipts** (TraceableValue).
- **Combined:** Total_Receipts_Global = Admin_Fund_Receipts.amount + Capital_Fund_Receipts.amount. Effective_Levy_Receipts = Total_Receipts_Global.

**Acceptable report types (whitelist – use document_register names or equivalent):**
${PHASE_2_RECEIPTS_REPORT_WHITELIST.join("\n• ")}

- Prefer reports whose titles or content explicitly indicate **receipts**, **payments**, **collections**, **contributions**, or **levy received** for the year. If a single report contains both Admin and Capital sections, extract each fund total separately and sum.
- Requirements: Must cover the audit FY; must segregate or be clearly attributable to Admin vs Capital/Sinking Fund.

**Fallback (if Admin & Capital separate fund reports are not available):**
- If evidence contains a **single combined** cash-based receipt summary that segregates Admin and Capital receipts for the FY, extract each fund total separately into **Admin_Fund_Receipts** and **Capital_Fund_Receipts**; then Total_Receipts_Global = sum; Effective_Levy_Receipts = Total_Receipts_Global.

**Prohibited Evidence (HARD STOP):**
- General Ledger alone; Trial Balance alone; Financial Statements or Notes (alone); management summaries without receipt/collection-level backing. If neither (1) Admin & Capital fund-specific receipt summaries from the whitelist nor (2) a single combined Tier 1 cash-based receipt summary exists, mark as Not Resolved – Boundary Defined.

/** Phase 2 – GST COMPONENT (STANDARD LEVIES ONLY) – Rule set */
export const PHASE_2_GST_RULES_PROMPT = `
--- PHASE 2 – GST COMPONENT (STANDARD LEVIES ONLY) – MANDATORY ---
RULE SET (ENFORCE): GST is applied only to (B1) STANDARD LEVIES. Administrative Fund and Capital / Sinking Fund calculated separately. You MUST apply this rule set.

**GST Registration Determination (MANDATORY FIRST STEP):**
- The plan's GST registration status MUST be assessed before applying any GST calculation.
- Determine GST registration by checking for GST accounts or indicators in: General Ledger, Trial Balance, or Balance Sheet.
- Indicators include: GST Payable, GST Collected, GST Receivable, GST Clearing, Net GST position disclosed. A GST line with $0 balance still counts as an indicator.
- If no GST indicators exist → treat the plan as NOT registered for GST.

**GST Application Rule:**
- If NOT registered for GST → No GST component on standard levies. GST_Admin = 0, GST_Sink = 0, GST_Special = 0.
- If registered for GST → GST_Admin = 10% × Sub_Levies_Standard_Admin; GST_Sink = 10% × Sub_Levies_Standard_Sink; GST_Special = 0 (no GST on special levies). Total_GST_Raised = GST_Admin + GST_Sink + GST_Special.

**Calculation Constraint – GST only on (B1) STANDARD LEVIES:**
GST must NOT be applied to: Opening balances, Levies in arrears, Levies paid in advance, Special levies, Interest, Recoveries, or Adjustments.

**Evidence Boundary:**
- GST registration status is inferred only from GL / TB / Balance Sheet structure.
- No reliance on: BAS lodgements, ATO records, GST reconciliation worksheets, Financial Statement notes alone. These are out of scope for Phase 2.
