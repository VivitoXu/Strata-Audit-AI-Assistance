- **CurrentYear_Arrears** = Sum of current_year from same Arrears rows.
- **CurrentYear_Advance** = Sum of current_year from same Advance rows.

**PROHIBITED:** Do NOT use Levy Position Report, Owner Ledger, GL, or any non-bs_extract source for these four fields.

**Arrears vs Advance (identify by Dr/Cr):** Levies in Arrears = Debit (Dr) = asset. Levies in Advance = Credit (Cr) = liability. If bs_extract has a single "Levy Receivable" with Cr, treat as Advance.

--- PHASE 2 – TOTAL RECEIPTS (GLOBAL) – MANDATORY (ADMIN & CAPITAL ACTUAL PAYMENTS) ---
RULE SET (ENFORCE): Total_Receipts_Global and Effective_Levy_Receipts MUST be sourced by actively finding **two** receipt/payment summaries for the audit FY: (1) **Administrative Fund** receipts for the year, (2) **Capital / Sinking Fund** receipts for the year. Non-compliance → Not Resolved – Boundary Defined.

**Definition:** Output **Admin_Fund_Receipts** and **Capital_Fund_Receipts** as separate TraceableValue fields. Total_Receipts_Global = Admin_Fund_Receipts.amount + Capital_Fund_Receipts.amount. Effective_Levy_Receipts = Total_Receipts_Global. Do NOT output or use Non_Levy_Income.

**Admin & Capital Actual Payments approach (PRIMARY – REQUIRED):**
- **Admin Fund:** Actively search for an **Administrative Fund** receipt or payment summary (or levy/contribution summary) for the audit financial year (intake_summary.financial_year). The report MUST be identifiable as Admin Fund (by title, section, or fund column). Output the total as **Admin_Fund_Receipts** (TraceableValue with source_doc_id, page_ref, note, verbatim_quote).
- **Capital / Sinking Fund:** Actively search for a **Capital / Sinking Fund** receipt or payment summary (or levy/contribution summary) for the same FY. The report MUST be identifiable as Capital or Sinking Fund. Output the total as **Capital_Fund_Receipts** (TraceableValue).
- **Combined:** Total_Receipts_Global = Admin_Fund_Receipts.amount + Capital_Fund_Receipts.amount. Effective_Levy_Receipts = Total_Receipts_Global.

**Preferred report types (use first when available):**
• ${PHASE_2_RECEIPTS_PREFERRED.join("\n• ")}

**Also acceptable report types (whitelist – use document_register names or equivalent):**
• ${PHASE_2_RECEIPTS_REPORT_WHITELIST.join("\n• ")}

- If a single report contains both Admin and Capital sections, extract each fund total separately and sum.
- Requirements: Must cover the audit FY; must segregate or be clearly attributable to Admin vs Capital/Sinking Fund.

**Fallback (if Admin & Capital separate fund reports are not available):**
- If evidence contains a **single combined** cash-based receipt summary that segregates Admin and Capital receipts for the FY, extract each fund total separately into **Admin_Fund_Receipts** and **Capital_Fund_Receipts**; then Total_Receipts_Global = sum; Effective_Levy_Receipts = Total_Receipts_Global.

**Prohibited Evidence (HARD STOP):**
- General Ledger alone; Trial Balance alone; Financial Statements or Notes (alone); management summaries without receipt/collection-level backing. If neither (1) Admin & Capital fund-specific receipt summaries from the preferred list or whitelist nor (2) a single combined Tier 1 cash-based receipt summary exists, mark as Not Resolved – Boundary Defined.

/** Phase 2 – GST COMPONENT (STANDARD LEVIES ONLY) – Rule set */
export const PHASE_2_GST_RULES_PROMPT = `
--- PHASE 2 – GST COMPONENT (STANDARD LEVIES ONLY) – MANDATORY ---
RULE SET (ENFORCE): GST is applied only to (B1) STANDARD LEVIES. Administrative Fund and Capital / Sinking Fund calculated separately. You MUST apply this rule set.

**GST Registration Determination (MANDATORY FIRST STEP):**
- The plan's GST registration status MUST be assessed before applying any GST calculation.
- Determine GST registration by checking for GST accounts or indicators in: General Ledger, Trial Balance, or Balance Sheet.
- Indicators include: GST Payable, GST Collected, GST Receivable, GST Clearing, Net GST position disclosed. A GST line with $0 balance still counts as an indicator.
- If no GST indicators exist → treat the plan as NOT registered for GST.

**GST Application Rule:**
- If NOT registered for GST → No GST component on standard levies. GST_Admin = 0, GST_Sink = 0, GST_Special = 0.
- If registered for GST → GST_Admin = 10% × Sub_Levies_Standard_Admin; GST_Sink = 10% × Sub_Levies_Standard_Sink; GST_Special = 0 (no GST on special levies). Total_GST_Raised = GST_Admin + GST_Sink + GST_Special.

**Calculation Constraint – GST only on (B1) STANDARD LEVIES:**
GST must NOT be applied to: Opening balances, Levies in arrears, Levies paid in advance, Special levies, Interest, Recoveries, or Adjustments.

**Evidence Boundary:**
- GST registration status is inferred only from GL / TB / Balance Sheet structure.
- No reliance on: BAS lodgements, ATO records, GST reconciliation worksheets, Financial Statement notes alone. These are out of scope for Phase 2.
