export const PHASE_2_COLUMN_DATE_MAP = `
--- MANDATORY – COLUMN IDENTIFICATION BY DATE (DO NOT SKIP) ---
Before filling PriorYear_Arrears, PriorYear_Advance, CurrentYear_Arrears, or CurrentYear_Advance, you MUST perform this step. Do NOT rely on column labels like "Prior Year" / "Current Year" / "2023" / "2024" alone – map by **reporting date**.

**Step 1 – Derive FY dates from intake_summary.financial_year:**
- Parse intake_summary.financial_year (e.g. "01/07/2024 - 30/06/2025" or "30/06/2025").
- **Current FY end date** = last day of the audit FY (e.g. 30/06/2025).
- **Prior FY end date** = last day of the year before the audit FY (e.g. 30/06/2024).

**Step 2 – Identify the reporting date of EACH Balance Sheet column:**
- From the Financial Statement Balance Sheet, read the column header or footnote for each numeric column (e.g. "As at 30 June 2025", "30 Jun 2024", "2024", "2023").
- Resolve each to a single **reporting date** (the "as at" date for that column).
- If the FS has two columns, you must determine: Column_A_Date = ? ; Column_B_Date = ?.

**Step 3 – Map columns by date (not by left/right or label text):**
- **PriorYearColumn** = the column whose reporting date equals **Prior FY end date** (e.g. 30/06/2024). Use this column ONLY for PriorYear_Arrears and PriorYear_Advance.
- **CurrentYearColumn** = the column whose reporting date equals **Current FY end date** (e.g. 30/06/2025). Use this column ONLY for CurrentYear_Arrears and CurrentYear_Advance.

**Step 4 – If you cannot map by date:**
- If the BS has only one column, or you cannot determine which column corresponds to prior FY end vs current FY end, do NOT guess.
- Do NOT fill PriorYear_Arrears, PriorYear_Advance, CurrentYear_Arrears, CurrentYear_Advance from an unmapped column.
- Mark as Not Resolved – Boundary Defined (e.g. in note or completion_outputs.boundary_disclosure).

**Key:** Use **date** to decide which column is Prior Year and which is Current Year. Ignore whether the column is left or right; ignore label wording like "This Year" / "Last Year" – only the **as at date** counts. The field name tells you which column to use.

/** CRITICAL – Column mapping – the field name tells you which column to use. */
export const PHASE_2_LEVY_BALANCE_COLUMN_MAP = `
--- CRITICAL – LEVY BALANCE COLUMN MAPPING ---
Apply this mapping **after** you have identified PriorYearColumn and CurrentYearColumn by date (see COLUMN IDENTIFICATION BY DATE above).

**FIELD NAME = COLUMN (字段名 = 列):**
The field name directly tells you which Balance Sheet column to use:
- **PriorYear_Arrears** → Prior Year column (上年度列)
- **PriorYear_Advance** → Prior Year column (上年度列)
- **CurrentYear_Arrears** → Current Year column (本年度列)
- **CurrentYear_Advance** → Current Year column (本年度列)

**STRICT MAPPING (严格映射):**
1. **PriorYear_Arrears** = Prior Year column ONLY
2. **PriorYear_Advance** = Prior Year column ONLY
3. **CurrentYear_Arrears** = Current Year column ONLY
4. **CurrentYear_Advance** = Current Year column ONLY

**PROHIBITED (严格禁止):**
❌ DO NOT put Prior Year figures into CurrentYear_* fields
❌ DO NOT put Current Year figures into PriorYear_* fields
❌ DO NOT swap Arrears and Advance amounts

**Arrears vs Advance (identify by Dr/Cr):** Levies in Arrears = Debit (Dr) = asset (owners owe scheme). Levies in Advance = Credit (Cr) = liability (scheme owes future service). If a single "Levy Receivable" line shows Cr balance, treat as Advance. Do NOT swap Arrears and Advance amounts.

--- PHASE 2 – PRIOR YEAR LEVY BALANCES – MANDATORY ---
RULE SET (ENFORCE): PriorYear_Arrears and PriorYear_Advance MUST be sourced STRICTLY from Prior Year Balance Sheet column. Non-compliance → Not Resolved – Boundary Defined.

**Applicable Line Items (master_table: PriorYear_Arrears, PriorYear_Advance):**
- Levies in Arrears (Administrative Fund)
- Levies in Arrears (Capital / Sinking Fund)
- Levies Paid in Advance (Administrative Fund)
- Levies Paid in Advance (Capital / Sinking Fund)

**Evidence Requirement (STRICT – Sole Permitted Source):**
- **Prior Year Balance Sheet column** = the Balance Sheet column as at the end of the prior FY (last day of FY N-1). Acceptable forms: (a) standalone prior-year Financial Statement, or (b) the "Prior Year" / "Comparative" column on the current-year Financial Statement.
- Validation: balance sheet date MUST agree with intake_summary.financial_year (prior year end). If FY is 01/07/2024–30/06/2025, prior year end = 30/06/2024.
- Balance direction: Levies in Arrears → Debit (Dr); Levies Paid in Advance → Credit (Cr). If a single "Levy Receivable" shows a credit balance, treat as Advance (prepayment).
- Fund segregation: Administrative Fund and Capital/Sinking Fund balances must be validated independently. If prior-year BS shows combined figure only, extract it and allocate per notes; if no breakdown exists, document as single figure and note "no fund breakdown on prior-year BS".

**Prohibited Evidence (HARD STOP – Do NOT use for PriorYear_Arrears/PriorYear_Advance):**
- Levy Position / Arrears Reports
- Owner / Lot Ledgers
- Receipts or Cash Collection Reports
- General Ledger / Trial Balance
- Financial Statement Notes (alone)
If not traceable to Prior Year Balance Sheet column, mark as Not Resolved – Boundary Defined.

**Account Name / Terminology Reference (for identification only; evidence remains Prior Year BS column):**
Levies in Arrears: Levy Arrears, Outstanding Levies, Levy Receivable, Owners Contributions Receivable, Unpaid Levies, Contributions Receivable, Levy Debtors, Maintenance/Sinking Fund Arrears.
Levies in Advance: Levy in Advance, Prepaid Levies, Owners Contributions in Advance, Levy Prepayments, Advance Levy Payments.

**Failure Classification:**
- Balance not from Prior Year column → Evidence Incomplete
- Debit/Credit direction inconsistent → Evidence Incomplete
- Administrative and Capital Funds not separately aligned (when BS has breakdown) → Evidence Incomplete

RULE SET (ENFORCE): Total_Receipts_Global and Effective_Levy_Receipts MUST be sourced by actively finding **two** receipt/payment summaries for the audit FY: (1) **Administrative Fund** receipts for the year, (2) **Capital / Sinking Fund** receipts for the year. Non-compliance → Not Resolved – Boundary Defined.

**Definition:** Output **Admin_Fund_Receipts** and **Capital_Fund_Receipts** as separate TraceableValue fields. Total_Receipts_Global = Admin_Fund_Receipts.amount + Capital_Fund_Receipts.amount. Effective_Levy_Receipts = Total_Receipts_Global. Do NOT output or use Non_Levy_Income.

**Admin & Capital Actual Payments approach (PRIMARY – REQUIRED):**
- **Admin Fund:** Actively search for an **Administrative Fund** receipt or payment summary (or levy/contribution summary) for the audit financial year (intake_summary.financial_year). The report MUST be identifiable as Admin Fund (by title, section, or fund column). Output the total as **Admin_Fund_Receipts** (TraceableValue with source_doc_id, page_ref, note, verbatim_quote).
- **Capital / Sinking Fund:** Actively search for a **Capital / Sinking Fund** receipt or payment summary (or levy/contribution summary) for the same FY. The report MUST be identifiable as Capital or Sinking Fund. Output the total as **Capital_Fund_Receipts** (TraceableValue).
- **Combined:** Total_Receipts_Global = Admin_Fund_Receipts.amount + Capital_Fund_Receipts.amount. Effective_Levy_Receipts = Total_Receipts_Global.

**Preferred report types (use first when available):**
• ${PHASE_2_RECEIPTS_PREFERRED.join("\n• ")}

**Also acceptable report types (whitelist – use document_register names or equivalent):**
• ${PHASE_2_RECEIPTS_REPORT_WHITELIST.join("\n• ")}

- If a single report contains both Admin and Capital sections, extract each fund total separately and sum.
- Requirements: Must cover the audit FY; must segregate or be clearly attributable to Admin vs Capital/Sinking Fund.

**Fallback (if Admin & Capital separate fund reports are not available):**
- If evidence contains a **single combined** cash-based receipt summary that segregates Admin and Capital receipts for the FY, extract each fund total separately into **Admin_Fund_Receipts** and **Capital_Fund_Receipts**; then Total_Receipts_Global = sum; Effective_Levy_Receipts = Total_Receipts_Global.

**Prohibited Evidence (HARD STOP):**
- General Ledger alone; Trial Balance alone; Financial Statements or Notes (alone); management summaries without receipt/collection-level backing. If neither (1) Admin & Capital fund-specific receipt summaries from the preferred list or whitelist nor (2) a single combined Tier 1 cash-based receipt summary exists, mark as Not Resolved – Boundary Defined.

/** Phase 2 – GST COMPONENT (STANDARD LEVIES ONLY) – Rule set */
export const PHASE_2_GST_RULES_PROMPT = `
--- PHASE 2 – GST COMPONENT (STANDARD LEVIES ONLY) – MANDATORY ---
RULE SET (ENFORCE): GST is applied only to (B1) STANDARD LEVIES. Administrative Fund and Capital / Sinking Fund calculated separately. You MUST apply this rule set.

**GST Registration Determination (MANDATORY FIRST STEP):**
- The plan's GST registration status MUST be assessed before applying any GST calculation.
- Determine GST registration by checking for GST accounts or indicators in: General Ledger, Trial Balance, or Balance Sheet.
- Indicators include: GST Payable, GST Collected, GST Receivable, GST Clearing, Net GST position disclosed. A GST line with $0 balance still counts as an indicator.
- If no GST indicators exist → treat the plan as NOT registered for GST.

**GST Application Rule:**
- If NOT registered for GST → No GST component on standard levies. GST_Admin = 0, GST_Sink = 0, GST_Special = 0.
- If registered for GST → GST_Admin = 10% × Sub_Levies_Standard_Admin; GST_Sink = 10% × Sub_Levies_Standard_Sink; GST_Special = 0 (no GST on special levies). Total_GST_Raised = GST_Admin + GST_Sink + GST_Special.

**Calculation Constraint – GST only on (B1) STANDARD LEVIES:**
GST must NOT be applied to: Opening balances, Levies in arrears, Levies paid in advance, Special levies, Interest, Recoveries, or Adjustments.

**Evidence Boundary:**
- GST registration status is inferred only from GL / TB / Balance Sheet structure.
- No reliance on: BAS lodgements, ATO records, GST reconciliation worksheets, Financial Statement notes alone. These are out of scope for Phase 2.
